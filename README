The folowing files are elaborations taken from my academic experience in numerical analisys (written in matlab) solving linear systems 
of linear equations (triangular, bidiagonal matrices), LU factorizations, Cholesky decomposition, linear differential equations, 
Crank-Nicolson and integration (euler method).
